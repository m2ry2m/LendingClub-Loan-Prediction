LendingClub Loan Data Prediction
A beginner-friendly machine learning project using LendingClub loan dataset to predict whether a loan will be fully paid or charged off.
Project Overview
LendingClub is a peer-to-peer lending company where people can apply for loans. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts the loan status based on customer and loan information.

This is a great project for beginners to practice:
- Data cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Building a prediction model
- Evaluating model performance
Dataset
The dataset contains loan applications with information such as:
- Loan amount
- Interest rate
- Term (36 or 60 months)
- Credit history
- Income
- Loan status (target variable: fully paid or charged off)
Project Workflow
1. Data Cleaning
   - Handle missing values
   - Remove irrelevant columns

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Visualize loan distributions
   - Understand relationships between features and loan status

3. Feature Engineering
   - Convert categorical variables into numerical (dummy variables)

4. Modeling
   - Train a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
   - Split data into training and testing sets

5. Evaluation
   - Check accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
   - Confusion matrix to see correct/incorrect predictions
Technologies Used
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Scikit-learn
Results
- The model predicts whether a loan will be fully paid or charged off.
- Achieved good performance with accuracy and recall (details inside the notebook).
